# Neko Bot Framework
A very powerful (not) framework to power your discord bots with! With many features to fulfill all your needs for bots.
## Why did you make this?
Because I was tired of writing the same code for all my bots over and over again. Isn't it easier to keep my core for all bots in a very cute github repo for everyone to use if they want to? Doesn't hurt anybody to be able to build a bot in a few lines.
## Example?
Please refer to src/examples folder.
